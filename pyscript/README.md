I started learning HTML5 and CSS3 for web front-end design a few weeks ago.

I took two terms of Python programming and began with the freeCodeCamp website, a free learning platform and best practice, before deciding to begin self-learning in Google and YouTube on web front end.

I've already finished the "new" responsive web design course.
and I am doing research on the internet about the web front end roadmap, which requires learning JavaScript after learning HTML5 and CSS3 to make a dynamic web and be a front end developer. After that, I began learning JavaScript through FreeCodeCamp and YouTube videos, with the course title "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures," but I found the syntax to be too complex for me, and I was more familiar with the Python programming language, so I abandoned the JavaScript programming language after a while. Fortunately, I discovered Pyscript, which I can use instead of JavaScript but is not as powerful as JavaScript because it is a new framework and not stable, but it still makes me happy because I can continue with Python, I can use PyScript for the frontend and for design functions, I will be using CSS3 more and more, and I also have a plan to learn Django for the backend and server site in the future.

Thanks to Youtube Channel: 1littlecoder

I take the Pyscript tutorial from it and read the online document to solve other problems.

I will share my learning journey with PyScript, some errors that I face, and how I solve the problem.

I hope everyone likes it and enjoys reading.
You are welcome to commend me and offer me some advice.
Best regardÂ
